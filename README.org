* rtx-mode

Syntax highlighting support for https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium-recursive

Depends on Emacs 29 or later (for builtin tree-sitter support).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package rtx-mode
  :defer t
  :load-path "~/where/you/cloned/rtx-mode"
  :mode (("\\.rtx\\'" . rtx-mode)))
#+end_src

Do =M-x rtx-install-tree-sitter= once to install the rtx tree-sitter library.

** Build emacs with tree-sitter support
Since Emacs 29 isn't in most repos yet, you probably have to build it yourself.

The following will install tree-sitter to /usr/local/lib:
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter.git
  cd tree-sitter/
  make
  sudo make install
#+end_src

Put this in ~/.bashrc:

#+begin_src sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
#+end_src

And build emacs =--with-tree-sitter=, e.g.
#+begin_src sh
./configure --with-x=yes --with-native-compilation --with-json --with-tree-sitter --prefix=$HOME/PREFIX/emacs
#+end_src
(native-compilation requires libgccjit-10-dev but makes everything faster)
